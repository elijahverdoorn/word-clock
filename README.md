# Word Clock

The word clock is a classic electronics project. It is a clock that displays the time in words rather than in numbers - for example, rather than reading "12:15", it would read "IT IS QUARTER PAST TWELVE". The clock relies on an external clock module so that it doesn't lose time, and remains accurate to a degree that the LED display doesn't nearly have the precision to match.

This code was deployed on an Arduino Uno platform.
